**There are many doubts among people who are starting professional activity (or those who have not started, but still should) about creating their blog. The benefits of having a blog are enormous, and the effort, once you've practiced, will also be small.**

## So why? To prove your qualifications! (Mainly)

### Reasons Why This Will Help You
Let's consider these reasons from the employer's perspective:
 - You prove your knowledge of a given topic. To write about something, first, you need to spend a lot of time on research or your contemplation.
 - You show that you have a desire to share knowledge. This is, in a way, proof of your dedication to the topic.
 - You have proven knowledge that will be somewhat practical.

### Just having your internet corner will also be convenient for you

You're doing a collection of your reflections on various topics. You have a chance to talk yourself out in your corner. Not only that, but you build your archive of what you have been doing, where you have gone. This sometimes has a different end because you may feel depressed by your laziness, but that's okay! This will lead to motivation.

  You will also improve your **writing skills**.

### Don't think you are not a knowledgeable person. That is absurd!
Because the truth is, there will always be someone who knows less than you. Someone who has 3 *weeks* of experience on a broader topic while you have 3* months* of experience behind you. *

### Creating a blog is not that difficult, and It does not risk being hacked
Maybe these conclusions sound like a hat, but the excuses are different. There are technologies like **Static Site Generators**. Which works extra *out of the box*. Their field of attack (scope) is also low due to the lack of databases. I will leave further considerations on the benefits of generators for later posts.
