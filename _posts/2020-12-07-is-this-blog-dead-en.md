## Admission word...

It's been quite a few months since the last post - as many as 6 (it's scary!). By answering the question in the subject right away. Is not. I also don't want it to be. You could say that I was constantly thinking about the blog and every week these thoughts were scrolling like "I'll write a post about what I've been doing!", Or "I'll add a" Resources "tab on the blog for more beginners than me, or" I'll do a marathon with Hack The Box. and I will share my knowledge."

And here I must admit, I have a lot of ideas, even this confusion in my head did not give me enough focus to write this post, start a marathon. There was always an excuse like "Ah! Maybe I'll make a container in Docker" / "I'll program in bash! Then the BugBounty marathon". This is obviously not a catastrophe of what I did. Because in the end, I didn't completely stand still, although the holiday burnout made me understand that maybe having technical knowledge was not enough. I have a lot to improve in soft skills and constant self-improvement is my obsession: p.

## Further Plans

But it's worth making plans and when will the posts and these ideas resume!
I warn you in advance that it will be after January 22nd. There are vocational exams for technical schools around these days. Rather, I want to contribute to it and have a free mindset of improvement.
So let's get down to business;)
1. You will see the topic of how to host a blog on GitHub
1. An overview of how to use Docker and docker-compose will appear, and an overview of the [blackarch-zsh](https://github.com/Cloufish/dockerfiles) project. Which I think is a much better solution than the resource-hungry Kali Linux in the Virtual Machine
1. There will be an overview of the [bugbounty-framework-project](https://github.com/Cloufish/bug_bounty_framework) and encouragement to automate tasks using programming languages
1. Overview of the [Worldwide ITSec Specialists](https://github.com/Cloufish/bug_bounty_framework) project will appear
1. After that / Be and in progress I think we'll start with a bang by doing Hack The Boxy and THM (if you win prizes on [Advent of Cyber ​​2](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2)
1. I will also discuss the subject of Bug-Hunting, my motivational crap (; P)
1. Something I want to touch upon and discuss is the programming language "nim", which is by principles elegant, expressive, effective, open-source, has a great community, and has an encouraging future. I've already read a bit about him ;) and I'm really excited!
1. Other topics, not related to ITSec, such as language learning, music, playing the guitar, but in this, I have an even bigger Impostor-Syndrome than in ITSec hah, we'll see, I have some valuable topics, although I am of course a constant student, not an expert :)
